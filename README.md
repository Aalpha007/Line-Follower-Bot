# Line Follower Bot (using Arduino)
This is a complete repository of a working Line Follower Bot. This not just a simple line follower bot but this is also an obstacle removing bot. If there is any object infront of the bot then it pushes the obstacle away using a rack and pinion mechanism.

I have uploaded the Arduino code and also a detailed manual for making this bot work. The actual picture of the bot is also uploaded in the repository.

Don't forget to calibrate your IR array sensor according to the track.
